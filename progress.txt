## 2026-01-19: Implemented tasks/ folder management functions

### Completed Task: Create tasks/ folder management functions

Added comprehensive functions to `ralphy.sh` for managing task files in the `tasks/` folder:

**Core Functions:**
- `init_tasks_folder()` - Creates tasks/ folder if it doesn't exist
- `get_next_task_number()` - Generates sequential 3-digit task numbers (001, 002, etc.)
- `slugify_task_name()` - Converts task names to filename-safe slugs
- `create_task_file()` - Creates new task files with the PRD-specified template
- `get_task_file()` - Finds task file by number, handling status prefixes
- `parse_task_field()` - Extracts fields (status, next_agent, task_name, task_number)
- `get_task_status()` - Gets task status by task number
- `update_task_field()` - Updates status or next_agent fields
- `update_subtask_status()` - Updates subtask status and attempt counts
- `rename_task_with_status()` - Adds/removes status prefixes like [Needs-Human]
- `list_task_files()` - Lists all task files sorted by number
- `get_next_pending_task_file()` - Gets next actionable task
- `count_tasks_by_status()` - Counts tasks by status type
- `enforce_task_line_limit()` - Enforces 150-line limit on task files
- `check_waiting_tasks()` - Unblocks tasks waiting on a completed task

**Task File Format:**
```markdown
# Task 001: [Name]
## Status: In Progress | Needs-Human | Waiting on Task X | Complete
## Next Agent: research | implement | test-typecheck | test-terminal | test-browser | test-automated

### Research — Status: Pending | Attempts: 0/5
### Implementation — Status: Pending | Attempts: 0/5
### Test: Type Check — Status: Pending | Attempts: 0/5
### Test: Terminal Errors — Status: Pending | Attempts: 0/5
### Test: Browser — Status: Pending | Attempts: 0/5
### Test: Automated (Playwright) — Status: Pending | Attempts: 0/5
```

**Testing:**
- Created comprehensive test suite in `test_tasks_folder.sh`
- 48 tests covering all functions
- All tests pass

## 2026-01-19: Created prompts/research.txt with Context7 MCP instructions

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Implement task file CRUD** - Confirmed already complete (was implemented alongside tasks/ folder management)
2. **Create prompts/research.txt** - Created Research Agent prompt

**prompts/research.txt Features:**
- Template placeholders: `{{TASK_FILE}}`, `{{TASK_NAME}}`
- Codebase exploration instructions (search patterns, find related files)
- Context7 MCP usage examples for external library documentation:
  - `resolve-library-id` to find library IDs
  - `query-docs` to fetch documentation
- Output requirements (update task file Research section, set Next Agent to "implement")
- Clear rules: NO implementation code, only gather and document information

**Testing:**
- Created `test_prompts.sh` with 18 tests for prompt files
- Tests verify: file existence, required placeholders, Context7 instructions, output requirements
- All 66 tests pass (48 task folder + 18 prompt tests)

## 2026-01-19: Created prompts/implement.txt with reasoning documentation

### Completed Task: Create prompts/implement.txt (document reasoning, not just changes)

**prompts/implement.txt Features:**
- Template placeholders: `{{TASK_FILE}}`, `{{TASK_NAME}}`
- Instructions to read Research section first before coding
- Requirements for documenting reasoning:
  - Approach chosen
  - Alternatives considered
  - Why this approach was selected
  - Key decisions made
  - Files changed
- Output requirements (update task file Implementation section, set Next Agent to "test-typecheck")
- Failure handling (5 attempts, Needs-Human marking)
- Clear rules: follow patterns from research, keep changes focused, don't over-engineer

**Testing:**
- Added 10 new tests to `test_prompts.sh` for implement.txt
- Tests verify: file existence, placeholders, reasoning requirements, output requirements, research reading, failure handling
- All 79 tests pass (48 task folder + 31 prompt tests)

## 2026-01-19: Created prompts/test-typecheck.txt

### Completed Task: Create prompts/test-typecheck.txt

**prompts/test-typecheck.txt Features:**
- Template placeholders: `{{TASK_FILE}}`, `{{TASK_NAME}}`
- Instructions to run `tsc --noEmit` or project's configured type check command
- Auto-detection of type check commands from package.json scripts
- Instructions to analyze and fix type errors introduced by implementation
- References Implementation section to understand what was changed
- Output requirements (update task file Test: Type Check section, set Next Agent to "test-terminal")
- Failure handling (5 attempts, Needs-Human marking)
- Clear rules: fix type errors, don't modify logic; if logic changes needed, go back to implement

**Testing:**
- Added 11 new tests to `test_prompts.sh` for test-typecheck.txt
- Tests verify: file existence, placeholders, tsc command, output requirements, failure handling, auto-detect instructions, implementation reference
- All 91 tests pass (48 task folder + 43 prompt tests)

## 2026-01-19: Created prompts/test-terminal.txt

### Completed Task: Create prompts/test-terminal.txt (start dev server, check errors)

**prompts/test-terminal.txt Features:**
- Template placeholders: `{{TASK_FILE}}`, `{{TASK_NAME}}`
- Instructions to start and monitor the dev server
- Auto-detection of dev server commands from package.json scripts (dev, start, serve, develop)
- Instructions to check for compile and runtime errors
- References Implementation section to understand what was changed
- Output requirements (update task file Test: Terminal Errors section, set Next Agent to "test-browser")
- Failure handling (5 attempts, Needs-Human marking)
- Timeout handling guidance (30 seconds for server startup)
- Clear rules: fix errors, don't modify logic; if logic changes needed, go back to implement

**Testing:**
- Added 11 new tests to `test_prompts.sh` for test-terminal.txt
- Tests verify: file existence, placeholders, dev server instructions, output requirements, failure handling, auto-detect instructions, implementation reference, error types
- All 106 tests pass (48 task folder + 58 prompt tests)

## 2026-01-19: Created prompts/test-browser.txt

### Completed Task: Create prompts/test-browser.txt (start server, test functionality via --chrome)

**prompts/test-browser.txt Features:**
- Template placeholders: `{{TASK_FILE}}`, `{{TASK_NAME}}`
- Instructions to start and manage its own dev server instance
- Browser automation instructions using --chrome mode
- Feature testing guidelines:
  - Navigate to relevant pages
  - Test user interactions (clicks, forms, etc.)
  - Verify visual elements render correctly
  - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- References Research and Implementation sections for context
- Output requirements (update task file Test: Browser section, set Next Agent to "test-automated")
- Failure handling (5 attempts, Needs-Human marking)
- Auto-detection of dev server commands from package.json
- Server lifecycle management (start, wait for ready, test, stop)
- Common issues checklist: broken imports, missing APIs, routing, state management, CSS issues

**Testing:**
- Added 14 new tests to `test_prompts.sh` for test-browser.txt
- Tests verify: file existence, placeholders, --chrome reference, dev server instructions, output requirements, failure handling, console checking, auto-detect instructions, own server emphasis
- All 125 tests pass (48 task folder + 77 prompt tests)
